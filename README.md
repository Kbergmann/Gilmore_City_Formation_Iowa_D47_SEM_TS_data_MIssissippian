Github repository for Anderson, N.T., Bergmann, K.B., Braun, M.G., Griffith, E.M., Saltzman, M.R., 2025. High-resolution record of global cooling during a large Mississippian positive carbon isotope excursion. Earth and Planetary Science Letters.

This repository contains data, code, and supporting materials for our study of the Kinderhookian-Osagean Boundary Excursion (KOBE) and the Mississippian Gilmore City Formation.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

This repository includes:

code/: Python scripts for data analysis and figure generation.

data/: Contains processed datasets for petrographic and isotopic analyses.

data/photomicrographs: corresponding GPS locations for all sample sites in Excel format

data/stitched_photomicrographs:
A composite stratigraphic column. Detailed drawn stratigraphic columns in PDF format.

data/sem_eds:
BSE images and EDS elemental maps from various samples.

data/clumped_isotope_results:
Processed and raw datasets of clumped isotope measurements from Mississippian samples collected at MIT. Includes raw voltage data for each analysis and processed outputs from ClumpyCrunch and BLIMP, as well as plots summarizing standards and results, in CSV, HTML, and PNG formats.

This repository is public.
